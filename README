This project contains header files for the OpenRISC architecture.

The headers contain architectural definitions, such as constants
related to SPRs, and so on.

Type `make' to generate the headers, `make install' to install.

Some headers (currently only or1k-sprs.h) are generated from XML
tables.  These tables are contained under the xml/ directory.
Generator scripts are contained under the scripts/ directory.
